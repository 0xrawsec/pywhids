**IMPORTANT:** this library and tools is still work in progress. Many WHIDS endpoints are not yet or partially supported. For the moment, only the needed has been implemented in order to provide some plugins' use cases. If you are willing to improve this library feel free either to open issues or make pull requests.

# Library and tools to interface with WHIDS

# EDRÂ plugins

The initial goal of this project is to provide working example plugins
to show how to integrate WHIDS with other open source tools.
